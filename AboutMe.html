            <em>"Failure is just a gateway for success" - Philip Lorenz DL. Sarmiento</em><br><br>
            Hi I am Philip, 20 years old from Norzagaray, Bulacan. I want to be a software developer someday. Currently, I am taking Bachelor of
            Science in Information Technology at PUP Santa Maria Bulacan Campus. I am the current president of Integrated Students in Information 
            Technology Education (iSITE) of PUPSMB. On this HTML Page it contains some basic information from me. It includes the following: hobbies,
            future destination, and my basic personal information it also include some details from my school like its history, mission, vision, and
            objectives. I failed many times but I cope up with it as I declared them as a challenge to strenghten my beliefs and to build up my self-esteem.
            One of my failure is programming, when I was on SHS days I hate it very much, but I did to study well and it helps me to build foundation knowledge 
            to know programming on the most easiest way. Yet on my current state I start to love programming because the way it do on us, as I build tools for
            my family, community, and society. It differs from every language but there is only one foundation that it enables us (coders) to use as basically
            as it was. Like in life, there are more obstacles, but if we conquer them or fight for it, it will be as fruitful as it can be that can transform you
            , me, and the whole world.
            </p>
